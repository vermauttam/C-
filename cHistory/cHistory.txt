1960 :
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchi, Brain Kernighan, Douglas Mcllroy and team wrote UNIX operating system
AT & T Bell lab was working on UNIX operating system which ran on PDP-7 (Which was written in Assembly language, also which was painful and 
hard to debug assembly code) therefore Ken Thompson decided do develop a High Level Programming Language to debug UNIX OS debug eaasily
so he designed a small language B (Bell) which was based on BCPL (Basic Combined Programming language)

1970 :

Dennis Ritchi joined the UNIX project and began progamming in B, In 1970 Bell Lab acquired PDP-11 for the UNIX project 

1971:
Thomposon rewrote a portion of B in PDP-11 but it was not working on PDP-11 due to the portability issue of language B
So, Dennis Ritchie started to develop the extended version of B to make it portable and name it as NB(NewB)


1972:

As it began to diverse more from B he changed named to C.

This language was stable enough by 1973 to be rewrite UNIX in C.
