Arithmetic:-

+   addition
-   subtration
*   multiplication
/   divisin:-
int/not int = not int quotient       sign depends upon if there is - or not
not int/ int = not int quotient
int/int = int = int quotient
%   modulus:-
int % int = modulus operator works only on integers                  sign depends upon the numerator



Logical:-

&&  Logical AND    evaluated if 1st one is true     if 1st is false then output is 0                   -integers will be true

||  Logical OR     if 1st one is true output is 1    if 1st one is false then it is evaluated          -integers will be true



Bitwise:-

Bitwise AND   (&)    normal AND operation
Bitwise OR    (|)    normal OR operation
Bitwise XOR   (^)    normal XOR operation


 Shift:-

Left Shift (<<)     Value << Count;      A<<B = A*2^n

Right Shift (>>)    Value >> Count;      A>>B = A/2^n


Relational/Comparison:-

>     Greater than 
>=    Greater than or equal to 
<     Less than
<=    Less than or equal to 
==    Equal to 
!=    Not equal to 




Assignment:-
